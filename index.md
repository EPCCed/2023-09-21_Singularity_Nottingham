This lesson provides an introduction to using the SingularityCE/Apptainer container platform. Singularity is particularly suited to running containers on infrastructure where users don't have administrative privileges, for example shared infrastructure such as High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. 

This lesson will introduce Singularity from scratch showing you how to run a simple container and building up to creating your own containers and running parallel scientific workloads on HPC infrastructure.

> ## Prerequisites
> You should have basic familiarity with using a command shell, and the lesson text will at times request that you "open a shell window", with an assumption that you know what this means.
> Under Linux or macOS it is assumed that you will access a bash shell (usually the default), using your Terminal application.
> Under Windows, Powershell or WSL should allow you to use the Unix instructions.
> The lessons will sometimes request that you use a text editor to create or edit files in particular directories. It is assumed that you either have an editor that you know how to use that runs within the working directory of your shell window (e.g. nano), or that if you use a graphical editor, that you can use it to read and write files into the working directory of your shell.
